Create a page that contains content of your choosing as well as spans of text that utilize javascript or jQuery to toggle the display setting of different elements on your page when clicked. While you can style the page in whatever way you wish, style these spans to look different from the rest of your text so their function is apparent.

Things to research for this:

jQuery toggle() function
jQuery css() function / Javascript style.display Property
jQuery click() function / Javascript .onclick property
While you can do this in a few different ways, one method you could use would be to add spans with the text "continue reading" (with unique styling) on your page that brings in additional information when clicked by toggling the CSS display setting on the text in question.
